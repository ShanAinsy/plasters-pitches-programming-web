       <h2 class= "blue"> Work values</h2>
        <p>As a professional, the skills and abilities that i appreciate most, are teamwork, communication, empathy, and hardship. I intend to encompass all of these attributes in every project or job i work in. Mostly, i value delivering quality work with a smile and recieving consistent customer satisfaction. </p> 
 
        <h2 class= "blue"> Life values</h2>
        <p> It is imperative, to make memories and never have a boring moment. My personal motto is 'if you can do it now, then don't wait'. 
        <br>I make it my priority to be able to look back and know that i did everything i could to be happy and make the best memories for myself, my friends and my family. I have become very aware that with only one life and hopefully a long time to live it, i am not confined to any limits, but must try my best to do everything and anything i can. Learn new things, try new skills, do anything the world has to offer. Hence why my list of hobbies and jobs may be long and varied. </p>
