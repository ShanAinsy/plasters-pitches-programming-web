        <h2 class= "blue"> Coding Experience</h2>
        <p>I have taken a course with codenation where i have learned how to code using python, html and css. As part of the course i have completed projects such as a python text-based adventure game, and writing a website using html and css. I also have personal interest in coding and have pursued it as a hobby where i create projects and develop my skills in my own time. </p>

        <h4 class= "center bold"> Digital clock</h4>
        <p class= "center"> Here i used the language C in the arduino IDE to build a digital clock which indicates the date, time and temperature. This is my first prototype, i am currently working on a larger screen version with more sensors </p>

        <h4 class= "center bold"> Team project: Text-based adventure game</h4>
        <p> This was a team project as a part of the codenation course, to produce a functioning text-based game. We chose to write a book style game for the players entertainment with choices and twists throughout the pathways. </p>

        <h4 class= "center bold"> Text based adventure game </h4>
        <p> This is a game i am currently writting in python which has various pathways and characters with health bars. In the near future i hope to adapt it into a graphical game to progress the gameplay and my own coding skills. </p>

        <h4 class="center bold"> Business website </h4>
        <p> I am currently in the process of designing a website to formulate my business idea 'plasters and pitches'. By using html, javascript and CSS i am hoping to create a communications page for sports teams and first aiders to organise match days and pitchside cover much easier.
